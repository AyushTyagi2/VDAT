// 5. Abstract (600-1000 words): ChipIN Centre under Chips to Startup (C2S) Programme was set
// up at C-DAC Bangalore by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY),
// Government of India, to catalyze chip designing in India by catering to fabless chip design
// ecosystem in the country. The facility provides Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) support to
// Academic Institutions, Startups and MSMEs by enabling access to SCL foundry and overseas
// foundries. It provides centralized EDA Design Tools (Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens-EDA,
// Xilinx, Ansys, Keysight, Silvaco) for IC design flow. The facility also provides design services like
// Fab compliance checks, validation, integration of designs, coordinating with identified firm for
// packaging of fabricated chips and enabling characterization and prototyping in a centralized
// manner. A significant component of this effort is exposing Academia, Govt. R&D organizations,
// and Startups/MSMEs to the entire VLSI Design flow necessary to have their designs ready for
// fabrication at SCL Foundry.
// This tutorial presents a comprehensive methodology for achieving foundry compliance and
// tapeout qualification of analog, digital, and mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) designs
// targeting the SCL (Semiconductor Laboratory) 180nm CMOS technology node. Successful
// silicon fabrication and packaging readiness require designers to follow a stringent sequence
// of steps that ensure full alignment with foundry-specific rules and process constraints. This
// Tutorial outlines the critical design practices and verification procedures required before and
// during physical verification to achieve fabrication-ready designs.
// Prior to physical verification, several key design preparations must be carried out to meet
// SCL’s process requirements. These include the placement of a unique silicon identification
// number, which is mandatory for traceability and foundry recordkeeping. Seal-ring insertion is
// also performed according to SCL’s guidelines to protect the active silicon during dicing and
// handling. Input/Output (IO) pad pitch requirements must be satisfied to enable proper
// interfacing with packaging and ensure manufacturability. The correct usage of clock pads and
// a robust power delivery strategy are also considered, ensuring the chip can be reliably
// powered and synchronized in real-world applications.
// Dummy cell insertion is applied to maintain metal density uniformity across the chip, which is
// crucial for avoiding topographical irregularities during chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP).
// The IO pad ring is constructed either with standard cells or with cut-cells, depending on the
// corner and routing configurations required. These steps are essential to establish a reliable
// and package-compatible layout boundary.

// Once the design is finalized, it enters the physical verification phase, which includes a suite of
// critical checks. Design Rule Checks (DRCs) ensure that the layout adheres to all geometrical
// constraints defined by the SCL 180nm PDK. Antenna Rule Checks are then performed to detect
// and resolve violations that could result in gate oxide damage during plasma etching steps.
// Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) verification ensures the physical layout matches the intended
// logical functionality and connectivity described in the netlist.
// Following LVS, parasitic extraction is performed to capture layout-induced resistive and
// capacitive effects. These parasitics are incorporated into post-layout SPICE simulations, which
// are run across multiple Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) corners to validate circuit
// functionality, performance, and robustness. Ensuring SPICE closure under all expected
// operating conditions is essential to guarantee first-silicon success.
// Upon successful verification, the design is prepared for tapeout sign-off. The final database,
// typically in GDSII format, is submitted along with required documentation including layer
// maps, fill patterns, test structures, and foundry checklists. Parallel to this, packaging
// compliance steps are carried out. This includes ensuring correct bond pad placement,
// adhering to bond wire length and loop height constraints, and generating a complete bonding
// diagram for packaging assembly. These packaging-specific checks are crucial for ensuring
// mechanical stability and electrical integrity post-fabrication.
// A structured checklist-driven approach is followed throughout the process to track
// compliance with all foundry and packaging specifications. The comprehensive methodology
// described ensures a high level of design reliability, facilitates a smooth tapeout process, and
// maximizes the likelihood of first-pass silicon success.

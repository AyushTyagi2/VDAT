FinFETs \nemerged as a revolutionary solution to address these challenges. The FinFET structure, \nwith its three-dimensional design, offers superior electrostatic control by wrapping the \ngate around a vertical fin. FinFETs have significantly enhanced transistor performance \nby improving electrostatic control and enabling continued scaling. Despite its \nadvantages, below the sub-22nm node, FinFETs possess challenges, such as parasitic \ncapacitance and resistance, fin depopulation, and variability in fin height and width. \nAdditionally, the fixed height of fins constrains area scaling, creating a need for further \ninnovations in transistor design.  \n\n    These limitations have prompted the development of new transistor architectures, \nsuch as stacked transistors, including Nanosheet FET, Forksheet FET, and CFET \n(Complementary FET), with improved power, performance, area, and cost (PPAC). \nThese architectures comprise vertically stacked multiple channels/sheets, reducing the \ndevice's overall footprint while maintaining or improving performance. Stacked \ndevices offer enhanced flexibility in gate control and channel width optimization and \nimprove power efficiency since multiple channels are integrated without increasing the \ndevice's lateral area, enabling more transistors to be packed into a smaller space.  \n\n           The integrity of the device (e.g., stacked transistor) raises several call-up \nchallenges related to the electrical and thermal reliability. The vertical stacking of \nchannels in these devices creates complex electrostatic interactions between sheets, \nleading to research on performance optimization. Further, owing to the compact stacked \ndesign, the channels/sheets are prone to self-heating problems, as the heat accumulates \nin the wrapped channel by low-thermal-conductivity material. Further, the heat \ngenerated in one sheet may couple to another, affecting the device's normal operation.  \nTherefore, the mutual coupling of electrical and thermal parameters is essentially \nconsidered for such stacked transistors. Electrical coupling, in one way or another, can \nincrease parasitic capacitance and interfere with channel signal transmission, leading to \ndegraded device performance.  \n\nOn the other hand, the mutual electrical and thermal coupling exacerbates self-heating \nissues, negatively affecting both performance and reliability. Furthermore, the \nadditional internal and external process variations, such as interface traps, random \ndopant fluctuation (RDF), gate metal grain granularities (MGG), line-edge roughness \n(LER), NBTI, etc., raise reliability concerns, which play a critical role, leading to \npremature device degradation and failure. Ensuring the long-term reliability of stacked \ntransistors requires careful consideration of these failure mechanisms and the \ndevelopment of mitigation strategies, which can help predict device aging.\n  This tutorial session will provide a detailed overview of the evolution from FinFETs \nto advanced stacked architectures, emphasizing their implications for high-frequency \nperformance, modeling complexity, and reliability challenges. Through the lens of both \ntraditional and ML-augmented TCAD approaches, we aim to explore the design \nconsiderations and circuit-level impacts that will define the next era of semiconductor \ninnovation.

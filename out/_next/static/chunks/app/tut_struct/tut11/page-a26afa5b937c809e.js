Traditional hardware design flows—often reliant on manual Hardware Description Language (HDL) coding and labour-intensive verification—can be time-consuming and error-prone, ultimately slowing innovation and prolonging time-to-market. To address these challenges, this comprehensive tutorial aims to equip participants with modern, model-based workflows that leverage the power of MATLAB and Simulink for streamlined HDL code generation and robust verification. The workshop demonstrates how system architects and engineers can move efficiently from conceptual algorithms to verified, synthesizable hardware designs, highlighting the use of HDL Coder and HDL Verifier—two industry-standard tools from MathWorks that facilitate automatic HDL code generation and comprehensive verification. This tutorial is designed for engineers, researchers, and students involved in FPGA, ASIC, or SoC design who wish to accelerate the design process by automating code generation from high-level models, ensure design correctness through systematic verification techniques, reduce human error inherent in manual HDL development, and achieve faster time-to-market for innovative products.",domain:"Electronics Design Automation, Testing and Verification",keywords:"Model-based design, HDL Code Generation, HDL Verification, Design Optimization",learningOutcomes:["Understand the advantages of model-based design for digital hardware systems and how it contrasts with traditional design methodologies","Gain practical experience in using HDL Coder to automatically generate efficient and synthesizable HDL code from high-level models","Acquire proficiency in verification workflows using HDL Verifier, including co-simulation and hardware-in-the-loop techniques","Learn how to optimize and customize generated HDL code to meet specific hardware requirements, such as timing, area, and power constraints","Develop the skills to integrate model-based workflows into existing hardware design environments, facilitating collaboration and scalability"],targetAudience:"Digital design engineers working with FPGAs, ASICs, or SoCs, system architects and verification engineers seeking to modernize their development workflows, faculty, researchers and students interested in applying MBD to hardware projects, and technical managers aiming to improve team productivity and design reliability.",prerequisites:"Understanding the basics of VLSI Design Flow.

FinFETs \nemerged as a revolutionary solution to address these challenges. The FinFET structure, \nwith its three-dimensional design, offers superior electrostatic control by wrapping the \ngate around a vertical fin. \n\nFinFETs have significantly enhanced transistor performance \nby improving electrostatic control and enabling continued scaling. Despite its \nadvantages, below the sub-22nm node, FinFETs possess challenges, such as parasitic \ncapacitance and resistance, fin depopulation, and variability in fin height and width. \nAdditionally, the fixed height of fins constrains area scaling, creating a need for further \ninnovations in transistor design.  \n\n     In particular, as transistor architectures become more complex, accurate \ncapacitive and resistive behavior modeling becomes critical for device circuit co\ndesign. For FinFETs, modeling the gate capacitance and resistive paths is relatively \nstraightforward. However, stacked transistor architectures introduce new complexities \ndue to the vertical arrangement of channels and gates. These vertical stacks create \ncapacitive coupling between the layers, which impacts device performance, particularly \nin high-frequency applications. \n\nNanosheet transistors offer improved high-frequency \nperformance due to reduced parasitic capacitance and improved electrostatic control. \nAccurate modeling of Nanosheet transistors in high-frequency and their circuit \nimplications are critical for leveraging their potential in modern technology nodes to \nensure signal integrity. Thus, designing a robust model (quasi-static or non-quasi\nstatic), addressing the SOEs, and evaluating the reliability challenges requires proper \nattention in agreeing to accept such stacked transistors as an integrated industrial fit. In \naddition, the radiation effects, particularly in advanced nodes where devices are more \nsensitive to external perturbations, also impact the resistive paths within the transistor. \nHigh-energy particles can induce transient faults or cause permanent resistance \nchanges, necessitating robust radiation-aware resistance models for mission-critical \napplications. \n\nTo navigate these complexities, modern Technology Computer-Aided \nDesign (TCAD) tools are increasingly being augmented with Machine Learning (ML) \ntechniques. ML-driven TCAD can accelerate device simulation, optimize fabrication \nparameters, and predict degradation pathways with greater accuracy. These data-driven \napproaches enable the exploration of large design spaces and support more robust \nmodeling of electrical behavior and reliability concerns. \n\n  This tutorial session will provide a detailed overview of the evolution from FinFETs \nto advanced stacked architectures, emphasizing their implications for high-frequency \nperformance, modeling complexity, and reliability challenges. Through the lens of both \ntraditional and ML-augmented TCAD approaches, we aim to explore the design \nconsiderations and circuit-level impacts that will define the next era of semiconductor \ninnovation.

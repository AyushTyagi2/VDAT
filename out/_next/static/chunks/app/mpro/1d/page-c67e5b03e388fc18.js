They cache recent address translations to avoid costly page-table walks. As server applications become increasingly data-intensive, their working dataset grows, making address translation a significant performance bottleneck. Thus, optimizing TLBs has become increasingly important. Addressing the demands of larger workloads necessitates larger TLBs; however, conventional SRAM-based TLBs have scalability challenges. As their capacity increases, they incur higher access latency, increased area overhead, and greater energy consumption.\n\nTo address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel TLB architecture that leverages STT-RAM technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of STT-RAM in CPU TLB architectures. STT-RAM offers about 4\xd7 the density of SRAM, enabling larger TLBs within the same area. STT-RAM also offers similar read latency and energy per read access as SRAM. While STT-RAM exhibits higher write latency and energy per write, TLBs perform very few write operations, making these drawbacks have minimal impact. These characteristics make STT-RAM a promising alternative for building scalable and energy-efficient TLBs.\n\nWe introduce Spin-TLB, a novel TLB architecture that incorporates STT-RAM into the Data-TLB (DTLB) and Secondary-TLB (STLB). This design choice is based on the observation that DTLBs and STLBs benefit more from increased capacity than Instruction-TLBs (ITLBs). Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Spin-TLB improves system performance (IPC) by up to 15.2% compared to a baseline with SRAM-based TLBs. It also reduces average TLB energy consumption by 64.3% and lowers the number of page walks by an average of 95.6%. These results highlight the potential of STT-RAM-based TLBs to significantly enhance CPU performance and energy efficiency.",mainContact:{name:"Tejeshwar Bhagatsing Thorawade",email:"tejeshwart@iitb.ac.in"}},{id:"201",time:"2:15 PM - 2:30 PM",title:"Design & Analysis of Low Power 9T SRAM Cell",authors:["Abhishek Prakash","SUNANDA AMBULKER"],abstract:"Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a crucial component of the memory hierarchy, which requires high endurance, high speed and low power consumption performance.

The main advantages of this approach include a smaller area, reduced operating speed, minimal power consumption, and improved switching rates in nanoscale technology, making it particularly appealing. The proposed single-bit SRAM cell in QCA is designed by integrating a single (MUX) with an AND gate. The benefits of this design in terms of cell count, total footprint, and clock cycle delay are evidenced by the observed results. Notably, when compared to other proposed QCA SRAM circuits, the proposed layout achieves an outstanding increase of 85.44% overall cell number, 99.2% on the QCA cost, and 75% on clock cycle latency.",mainContact:{name:"Pooran Singh",email:"pooran.singh@mahindrauniversity.edu.in"}},{id:"414",time:"2:45 PM - 3:00 PM",title:"Low-Power NBTI Resilient 12T SRAM Cell with Enhanced Reliability",authors:["Vipul Sahu","ARYAN KANNAUJIYA","Pranjal Verma","Ambika Prasad Shah"],abstract:"This work briefs an aging resilient SRAM cell for reliable data storage.

Conventional methods of securing memory are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated threats like hardware Trojans and reverse engineering attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Finite State Machine (FSM)-based locking mechanism designed to enhance the security of SRAM arrays through logic obfuscation. The proposed architecture requires specific input sequences to activate memory operations, thereby restricting unauthorized access and significantly improving system resilience against SAT-based and redesign attacks. To validate the approach, the locking mechanism is implemented on a 32\xd732 SRAM memory array, demonstrating its effectiveness at the architectural level. To address the scalability and power efficiency challenges associated with existing key-based approaches, our design minimizes circuit redundancy and ensures constant overhead irrespective of memory size. Furthermore, low-power design techniques specifically Dynamic VDD and Gated Ground are integrated into the memory architecture. These methods effectively reduce power consumption without compromising access times, thus demonstrating the viability of our solution in energy-constrained environments.

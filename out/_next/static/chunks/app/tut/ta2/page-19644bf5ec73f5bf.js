The\nbasic blocks of a boost converter are an inductor, two power switches and an output\ncapacitor. The power switch is driven by a control signal, whose duty cycle can be adjusted to\nachieve a high output voltage. In this tutorial, I will start with the basics of boost converters\nwhere I will discuss different performance metrics which determine the values of the inductor,\ncapacitor, frequency of the control signal and its duty cycle.\n\nThe control signal is generated using a negative feedback loop. Based on its implementation,\nthere are two popular types of control – the voltage mode control and the current mode\ncontrol. Voltage-mode control regulates the output voltage by adjusting the duty cycle of the\nswitching transistor based on voltage feedback. While straightforward, it faces challenges due\nto the inherent complex poles and right-half-plane (RHP) zero, which can complicate stability\nanalysis and design. Current-mode control enhances the voltage-mode approach by adding\nan inner current feedback loop.\n\nThis method improves transient response and provides inherent overcurrent protection. \nHowever, it may require additional components like current sense resistors or transformers,\nand careful design. We will discuss both these techniques in this tutorial. The current mode \ncontrol has different sub-types namely CCM, DCM and BCM control. \nEach of them has their own merits and demerits which will be discussed at length in\nthe tutorial. We also finally discuss the various factors which determine the efficiency of boost\nconverters.\n\nFinally, I will discuss the design details of a BCM current mode control boost converter along\nwith the feedback circuitry. I am confident this tutorial will provide a comprehensive learning\ncurve for the audience in the area of boost converter design.",domain:"Analog circuit design, Power management circuit design",keywords:"dc-dc, boost converter, voltage-mode control, current-mode control, duty cycle.",learningOutcomes:["a) Understanding the basic specifications of a boost converter. b) Learning about two control techniques in a boost converter. c) Design challenges in a boost converter with a high voltage conversion ratio."],targetAudience:"Master’s and Ph.D students, Researchers and Industry professionals.",prerequisites:"Basic circuit analysis, Laplace transform analysis, Transfer function design.",speakerBiographies:["\nSaravana Kumar is an Assistant Professor in the Microelectronics and VLSI group, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.
